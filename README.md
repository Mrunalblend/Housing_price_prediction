# Housing_price_prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust predictive model that can estimate property values based on various features of the housing data.

## Project Components
Data Cleaning: Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Outlier Detection: Identified and managed outliers to improve model performance and accuracy.

Data Visualization: Used visualization techniques to explore and understand data distributions and relationships.

One-Hot Encoding: Converted categorical variables into numerical format to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance.

K-Fold Cross-Validation: Employed K-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.

Grid Search CV: Conducted a Grid Search Cross-Validation to find the optimal model parameters and enhance predictive accuracy.

Model Export: Saved the trained model as a pickle file for easy deployment and future use.

## Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data processing and model development.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
Matplotlib: Plotting and visualization library.
